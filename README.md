# digital-skills

This course provides a hands-on introduction to statistical
thinking. It is assumed that the students are also following a
traditional statistics course in parallel. Topics covered include:

- Experiment design and data collection
- Forming and testing hypotheses
- Frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints
- Modelling and visualisation conclusions
- Quantifying uncertainty

No theoretical background is assumed, and concepts are learned
inuitively. Formalisations are included to round things off, but are
not the focus of the course.
