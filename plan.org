* Plan
** Visualisation as models
- Histograms: model a distribution
- Scatterplots: model a relationship
- Time-Series: model a causal effect
** Experiment design
- Random samples
- A/B testing
- The experimental pipeline
** Bayesian modelling
- The cards problem
- Monty Hall Problem
- The k-Meteorologists problem
** Hypothesis testing
- The garden of many paths
- Visualising fMRI data
- Visualising GWAS data
** Social issues
- Privacy: randomised response
- Fairness: Experimental analysis
- Safety: Robustness

* Histograms

** Introduction to histograms (45')
  1. Split the students in two groups 
  2. Have each group collect the height of every student 
  3. How can we summarise the data of each group? Introduce the
     concept of a historgram on the board
  4. Now the students will individually draw a histogram 
  5. Show two different histograms from two people in the same group. Why are they different?
  6. Now add a histogram from a person in another group. Why are those different?
** Pandas Histograms (45')
  1. Introduce Pandas histograms. First with fixed binary data.
  2. The uniform distribution
  3. Uncertainty of the coin toss, versus uncertainty about the coin bias.
  4. Each one of you should predict the result of a number of coin tosses.
  5. Let us do a histogram of the predictions. This is a binomial distribution.
** Randomess (45')
   1. Random algorithms using coins.
   2. Uncertainty versus randomness.
   3. An algorithm for generating random numbers:
	  1. Pass out cards with numbers to students
	  2. Randomly call out each student, have them write their number
         and name.
	  3. What is the distribution of numbers?
	  
** Uncertainty (45')
   1. Predicting events. Who will win the race?
   2. How many immigrants live in Switzerland? What do we mean by
      that?  Create confidence intervals.
   3. 
	  
* Scatter plots
  1. For the original data: add weight, eye colour, gender, exercise level.
  2. Summarise
