* Visualisation as models
** Histograms: model a distribution

*** Introduction to histograms (45')
	A (counting) histogram is defined as a collection of disjoint sets called *bins*
	
	$\{ A_i | i=1, \ldots, k\}$

	with associated counts $n_i$, so that, given some data $D$,

	$n_i(D) = \sum_{x \in D} 1\{x \in A_i\}$,
	where $n_i$ is the number of datapoints in $A_i$. Typically $A_i \subset R$.
	
	We can use the histogram as the model of a distribution. For that, we
	use the relative frequency of points in each bin:
	$p_i(D) = n_i(D) / \sum_{j} n_j(D)$.
	The selection of bins influences the model

	In-class activity:
   1. Split the students in two groups 
   2. Have each group collect the height of every student 
   3. How can we summarise the data of each group? Introduce the
	  concept of a historgram on the board
   4. Now the students will individually draw a histogram 
   5. Show two different histograms from two people in the same group. Why are they different?
   6. Now add a histogram from a person in another group. Why are those different?
*** Pandas Histograms (45')
See src/histograms/histogram.ipynb
    1. Introduce Pandas histograms. First with fixed binary data.
    2. The uniform distribution:
    3. Uncertainty of the coin toss, versus uncertainty about the coin bias.
    4. Each one of you should predict the result of a number of coin tosses.
    5. Let us do a histogram of the predictions. This is a binomial distribution.
*** Randomess (45')
 1. Random algorithms using coins.
 2. Uncertainty versus randomness.
 3. Coin-flipping experiment
	1. Everybody flips a coin 10 times.
	2. Record how many heads or tails you have.
	3. Then record how you threw the coin.
	4. Discuss if the coin is really random.
*** Uncertainty (45')
	1. Predicting events. Who will win the race?
	2. How many immigrants live in Switzerland? What do we mean by
   that?  Create confidence intervals.
** Time-Series: model a causal effect
*** Race times
*** Example: Crime statistics
*** Example: 
** Scatterplots: model a relationship
   1. For the original data: add weight, eye colour, gender, exercise level.
   2. Summarise 
** Homework Assignment: Take an existing plot from the web, re-create it, and try to improve it.

** Safety: Robustness



** A/B testing
 1. Comparing algorithms in the wild. Which is the best algorithm?
** The data science pipeline
 The experimental pipipeline has a number of different components. 
 1. Formulating the problem.
 2. Deciding what type of data is needed.
 3. Choosing the model and visualisation needed.
 4. Designing the experimental protocol.
 5. Generating data confirming to our assumptions.
 6. Testing the protocol on synthetic data. Is it working as expected?
 7. Now collect according to your protocol.

** Intro to Bayesian Reasoning
 1. The Cards Problem. 
	1. Print out a number of cards, with either [A|A], [A|B] or [B|B] on their sides.
	2. Get a card (say with face A), and ask what is the probability the other side is the same.
	3. Have the students perform the experiment with:
   1. Draw a random card.
   2. Count the number of people with A.
   3. Of those, count the number of people with A on the other side.
	4. It should be clear that 1/3 of people have [A|A] and of those 
 2. The Prisoner Problem.
 3. The lie dector test.
 4. Exercise: The k-Meteorologists problem
	1. Explain what is a model from this point of view.
	2.
